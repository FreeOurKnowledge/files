Thanks for proposing a new campaign on Project FOK! 

  Instructions:
  1. Add your campaign title in the Title field above. Try to use a positive, simple title that indicates the action you want researchers to take, in as few words as possible (see the [website](https://freeourknowledge.org/) for examples). The subtitle can then give more information on what the campaign is about (see below).
  2. Fill in as much of the below as you can, leaving question marks if you're unsure about something (these can be updated later as the details are worked out). Also feel free to delete any parts that aren't relevant. Note that the text between the arrows will not show up in the new issue. 
  3. Finally, when you're happy with everything click 'Submit new issue'... and let your friends/colleagues know about your new campaign!

  List anyone else who is proposing this campaign with you using their GitHub @username --->
* Campaign co-creator/s: ?

<!---
  Describe in once sentence what researchers are being asked to do (rather than what you're asking them to NOT do), and (if relevant) the critical mass at which action will be taken (see the [website](https://freeourknowledge.org/) for more examples). ---> 
* Subtitle: "Pledge to [INSERT ACTION HERE], along with [X] of your peers"

<!---
  Brief description of why this campaign is needed (try to be succinct, see freeourknowledge.org for examples) ---> 
* Rationale: ?

<!---
  Who is this campaign for? Describe any constraints on who can sign the pledge (e.g. only researchers in a particular field): --->
* Eligibility criteria: <e.g. Researchers in the fields of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology>

<!---
  What is the action that signatories will carry out (e.g. upload one dataset)? Ideally this should be public in some way, so we can monitor compliance after pledges activate. If there's any further details you'll need to also specify them here (e.g., list of boycotted/whitelisted journals). --->
* Action: ?

<!---
Indicate here what type of pledge you're inviting people to take:
- 'Conditional pledges' ask people to take action when some pre-determined critical mass of support is met ("When X researchers have signed this pledge, we will all take Y action together"). These campaigns aim to solve large-scale collective action problems by organising a critical mass of support prior to action being taken. Indicate this type of campaign by typing "Conditional: " and the number of signatures at which action will be taken (e.g., "Conditional: 100 signatures").
- 'Immediate pledges' are more suited to small-scale problems or those with less risk to individuals who sign the pledge. Indicate this type of campaign by typing "Immediate" --->
* Pledge type (Conditional/Immediate):

<!---
  Will the action be carried out for a particular duration (e.g., boycott certain journals for 2 years)? Otherwise, if this field is irrelevant (e.g., the pledge relates to a single action) you can just delete this part --->
* Pledge duration: ?
