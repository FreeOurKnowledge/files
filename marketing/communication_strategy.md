# Communication Strategy

Note: If you add anyhing here you should also add it to the ['Marketing checklist' issue template](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/templates/edit)

## Channels to contact with project updates
If you're planning to contact organisations about a project update, [open a new 'marketing blitz' issue in Github](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose) and follow the template/checklist to keep track of who you've contacted. Write a different pitch for each of the following categories, then copy to all. 

##### NOTE: THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE A DIRECT COPY OF THE [MARKETING CHECKLIST TEMPLATE](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues/templates/edit). IF IT ISN'T, OVERWRITE THE TEXT IN THE MARKETING CHECKLIST WITH THE FOLLOWING)

- [ ] Scott Aaronson (“…much of the serious content on the Internet remains sequestered behind pointless, artificial walls—walls that serve the interests of neither the readers nor the authors, but only of the wall-builders themselves. If I have a medical problem, why can’t I download the full text of clinical studies dealing with that problem? Why do so many researchers still not post their papers on their web pages—or if they do, then omit their early papers? When will we in academia get our act together enough to make the world’s scholarly output readable, for free, by anyone with a web browser?"
- Sir/Prof. Tim Gowers (argues, journals these days exist only to accommodate author prestige)
