#### Reasons other pledge sites might want to join forces

* Build momentum
  * people who sign one pledge are likely to sign others
  * get people onto a common mailing list so they can be informed on future actions
  * e.g. 90% of people who signed the FOK RR-Now petition agreed to future contact
* [Partnerships with open science organisations](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/partners.md)
* Increased traffic, driven by:
  * Other campaigns on common domain
  * Workshops (~monthly workshops to teach open science practices/ launch campaigns)
  * Evolving [communications strategy](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/communication_strategy.md)
  * Twitter (~1500 followers) and other channels (will be stepping up Facebook, Youtube etc. game)
  * Funding (via FOK funding)
  * Blog posts (coming soon)
* Possibly also:
  * Dedicated platform with user profiles, single-click pledging, etc
  * Published pledges (via [RIO Journal](https://riojournal.com/))
  * etc
