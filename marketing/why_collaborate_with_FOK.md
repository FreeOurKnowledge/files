#### Reasons other pledge sites might want to join forces

* Maintain and build momentum
  * get people onto a common mailing list so they can be prompted to act again
  * e.g. 90% of signatories to FOK RR-Now petition consented to future contact
  * future campaigns can invite larger/bolder actions, building momentum over time
* Develop replicable + effective processes
  * [marketing checklists](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/communication_strategy.md)
  * [campaign templates](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues/new/choose)
  * analyse outcomes following campaign completion, so we can learn and improve future campaigns
* Build stronger [partnerships with open science organisations](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/partners.md) together
* Increase traffic, due to:
  * Common domain/branding (e.g. someone signs a pledge and then looks to see what other campaigns exist)
  * Growing mailing list, including details on preferred actions (~600 people)
  * Twitter (~1500 followers) and other channels (will be stepping up Facebook, Youtube etc. game)
* Funding available, potential uses:
  * Social media advertising
  * Platform upgrade
  * Meta-research
* Coming soon:
  * Dedicated platform with user profiles, single-click pledging, etc
  * Published pledges (via [RIO Journal](https://riojournal.com/))
  * Workshops to teach open science practices (coming soon)
  * Blog posts (coming soon)
