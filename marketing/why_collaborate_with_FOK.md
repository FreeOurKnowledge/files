#### Reasons other pledge sites might want to join forces

* Maintain and build momentum
  * previous pledge initiatives are single-use/standalone, preventing other campaigns from building on their momentum
  * people who pledge once are likely to pledge again (e.g. 90% of [FOK RR-Now](https://freeourknowledge.org/2021-07-01-registered-reports-now_ecol-evol-biol/) signatories consented to future contact)
  * FOK gets people onto a common mailing list to build momentum and target campaigns effectively (via field or interests)
  * future campaigns can invite larger/bolder actions
* Develop replicable/effective processes
  * [marketing checklists](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/communication_strategy.md)
  * [campaign templates](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues/new/choose)
  * analyse impact following campaign completion, to learn and optimise future campaigns
* Increase traffic, due to:
  * Common domain/branding (e.g. someone signs a pledge and then looks to see what other campaigns exist)
  * Growing mailing list with data on field, interests, etc. (~600 people)
  * Twitter (~1500 followers) and other channels (will be stepping up Facebook, Youtube etc. game)
* Work together to build strong [partnerships with open science organisations](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/blob/master/marketing/partners.md)
* Funding available, potential uses:
  * Social media advertising
  * Platform upgrade
  * Meta-research
* Coming soon:
  * Dedicated platform with user profiles, single-click pledging, etc
  * Publishing pledges (via [RIO Journal](https://riojournal.com/))
  * Workshops to teach open science practices
  * Blog posts
