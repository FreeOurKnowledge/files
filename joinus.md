There are many ways you can get involved with the project, beyond pledging to [campaigns](/) and sharing them with your friends and colleagues:

* *Join our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/dFVBVz)* to stay informed as we develop the project.
* *Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/projectfok) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/projectFOK/)* 
* *Develop new campaigns*. You can propose new campaigns on our [Github repository](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adraft-campaign) by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/community/issues/new/choose), or help others develop their proposals by commenting on existing issues marked 'draft-campaign'.
* *Donate/share our [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rpjkz-test)*. We are a researcher-driven initiative and currently 100% self-funded, so every dollar helps.
* *Become an ambassador*. We're looking for people who can help spread the word to friends and colleagues within their institutions and research fields (e.g. via presentations, social media, and casual discussions). 
* *Want to make a greater contribution? Join the [Committee for Collective Action in Science](https://freeourknowledge.org/committee)). We are looking for people to contribute in the following roles:
  * *General member*. Give your input on how best to achieve our goals and help us move the project forward.
  * *Communications and marketing*. We're looking for skilled communicator/s who can help spread the word about this project (e.g. via social media, blogs, articles, and advertising).
  * *Software development*. There's plenty to do on both the front- and back-end software development, please get in touch if you have skills in this department.
  * *UX design*. The current platform is in a minimal viable product state, and we're looking for collaborators to help redesign and develop the user experience (currently coded in Jekkyl for Github Pages). 
  * *Secretary*. Help us stay organized and manage correspondence with interested researchers.
* *Metascience*. If you'd like to collaborate to analyse the data as it comes in, get in touch.
