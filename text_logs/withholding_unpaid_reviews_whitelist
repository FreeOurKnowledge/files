Once pledges activate, supporters of this campaign will refuse to serve as unpaid scientific reviewers for profitable publishers. However, they are free (and encouraged) to continue performing free reviews for the following community-friendly journals:
* Meta-Psychology
* Judgement & Decision Making
* Harvard Kennedy Misinformation Review
* Collabra: Psychology (UC Press)
* PLoS One
* Open Mind (MIT press, who also publish a few others of possible interest)
* Journal of Vision?
* J Numerical Cognition
* J Social and Political Psychology
* PeerJ

Note: This list is under development, please add any journals that you think should be on here. After the campaign launches, any proposals will need to be approved by the community before being added to the list
