Many scientific articles are currently published in subscription journals and locked behind paywalls. This model impedes research and diverts public funding to parasitic publishers, while relying almost entirely on the unpaid work of researchers. We believe that science should evolve towards a different publishing model in which all scientific publications are freely available to readers as open access, without charging authors unfair prices.

**For this reason, we will avoid serving as peer reviewers for venues that do not make publicly available the research that we review.** Instead, we will give priority to open-access venues in how we allocate our reviewing time and organizational efforts.

**Take the pledge [here](https://nofreeviewnoreview.org/)**
