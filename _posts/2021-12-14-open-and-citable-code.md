This campaign will be launching soon to coincide with the publication of our [preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/vrwm7) in [OHBM Aperture](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4022). In the meantime, you can help us finalise the campaign details by joining the discussion thread [here](https://github.com/FreeOurKnowledge/website/issues/30).
