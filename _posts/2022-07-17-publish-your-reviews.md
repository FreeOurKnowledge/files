#### Why publish your reviews?
* **Provide readers with additional context** on preprints, pointing out strengths, weaknesses, and unanswered questions.
* **Enable reuse** of peer reviews, thereby reducing burden on editors and reviewers.
* Bring discussions into the public domain, where readers can **enrich the conversation with diverse expertise**.
* **Surface the work of reviewers to a broader audience**, promoting greater recognition for this important work.
* **Catalyze a culture of open commenting on preprints** by surfacing hidden conversation.
